# Survey Form

The survey consists of 20 multiple choice and open ended questions divided into 4 sections, each an important aspect of the

These questions will help us gather quantifiable data and qualitative insights into their struggles, habits, and expectations. More specifically:
- Booking Struggles – We confirm if the gig search process is really their biggest issue.
- Promotion Tactics – We see where they already promote themselves & where our platform fits.
- Feature Validation – We ensure we’re building exactly what they need.
- Adoption Likelihood – We measure their actual interest in our platform.
